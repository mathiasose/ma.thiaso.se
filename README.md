============
My personal corner of the web. Hosts information about myself, and acts as a playground for me to learn new things about web development.

Contents and functionality
--------------------------
* CV that is hidden by default and can be shown by the click of a button, then be dismissed again.
* The same content available in both norwegian and english, easily switchable.
* Special CSS for print media so that it prints as a professional-looking CV.
** The design of the site should be primarily black/white and minimalistic so as to convert easily to print format.

Technologies
------------
* Source available on GitHub (duh)
* Development done in IntelliJ IDE
* Site hosted on a Raspberry Pi in my living room.
** Running Raspbian
** Apache webserver
*** Remember to look into nginx eventually.
* HTML5
* Compiled LESS CSS
** Compiled with WinLess
* Twitter Bootstrap 3
* AngularJS + jQuery
* Merriweather font

License
-------
* The rights to any technologies I have used (that I have listed above or forgotten to include in the list) obviously belong to their respective rights' holders.
* Personal information about myself (contact info, my picture, etc.) should obviously not be distributed anywhere without my permission.
* Otherwise you may do whatever you want with any functionality, design, ideas etc. I might have come up with. Attribution is appreciated but not required.
